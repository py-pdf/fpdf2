Several glands assist in digestion by secreting enzymes and fluids. These glands are crucial for the breakdown, absorption, and processing of food in the alimentary canal.

1. Salivary Glands
- Location: In the mouth (parotid, submandibular, sublingual glands)
- Structure: Acinar cells with ducts that open into the oral cavity.
- Function: Secrete saliva containing salivary amylase to begin starch digestion and mucus for lubrication.

2. Gastric Glands
- Location: Lining of the stomach (fundus and body)
- Structure: Chief cells (pepsinogen), parietal cells (HCl), mucous cells (mucus)
- Function: Pepsin digests proteins; HCl activates enzymes; mucus protects stomach lining.

3. Liver (with Gallbladder)
- Location: Upper right abdominal cavity below diaphragm.
- Structure: Made of hepatocytes arranged in lobules; bile ducts connect to gallbladder and intestine.
- Function: Produces bile for fat emulsification and vitamin absorption.

4. Pancreas
- Location: Behind the stomach near the duodenum.
- Structure: Acinar cells (exocrine); connected to intestine by pancreatic duct.
- Function: Secretes enzymes (amylase, trypsin, lipase) and bicarbonate to neutralize acid.

5. Intestinal Glands (Crypts of Lieberk√ºhn)
- Location: In the lining of the small intestine.
- Structure: Tubular glands with enzyme and mucus-secreting cells.
- Function: Secrete intestinal juice with enzymes (maltase, lactase, peptidase) for final digestion.

Conclusion:
These glands are essential for the digestion and absorption of food by secreting various enzymes and fluids tailored to break down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
